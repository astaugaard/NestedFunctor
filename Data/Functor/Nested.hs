Module      :  Control.Comonad.Sheet
Description :  Composition of functors with a type index tracking nesting.
Copyright   :  Copyright (c) 2014 Kenneth Foner

Maintainer  :  kenneth.foner@gmail.com
Stability   :  experimental
Portability :  non-portable

This module implements something akin to 'Data.Compose', but with a type index that tracks the order in which things
are nested. This makes it possible to write code using polymorphic recursion over the levels of the structure contained
in a 'Nested' value.

-- | @Flat x@ is the type index used for the base case of a 'Nested' value. Thus, a @(Nested (Flat []) Int@ is
--   isomorphic to a @[Int]@.
data Flat (x :: * -> *)
-- | @Nest o i@ is the type index used for the recursive case of a 'Nested' value: the @o@ parameter is the type 
--   constructors corresponding to the /outside/ levels, and the @i@ parameter is the single type constructor
--   corresponding to the /inner-most/ level. Thus, a @(Nested (Nest (Flat Maybe) []) Int)@ is isomorphic to a
--   @(Maybe [Int])@.
data Nest (o :: *) (i :: * -> *)

-- | A @Nested fs a@ is the composition of all the layers mentioned in @fs@, applied to an @a@. Specifically, the @fs@
--   parameter is a sort of snoc-list holding type constructors of kind @(* -> *)@. The outermost layer appears as the
--   parameter to @Flat@; the innermost layer appears as the rightmost argument to the outermost @Nest@. For instance:
--
-- >                  [Just ['a']]   :: [Maybe [Char]]
-- >             Flat [Just ['a']]   :: Nested (Flat []) (Maybe [Char])
-- >       Nest (Flat [Just ['a']])  :: Nested (Nest (Flat []) Maybe) [Char]
-- > Nest (Nest (Flat [Just ['a']])) :: Nested (Nest (Nest (Flat []) Maybe) []) Char
